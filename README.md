The aim of 21 With Primes is for a player and the computer to 
compete against each other to gather the most points while playing a single tile each turn with the 
goal of ensuring that the total for each round is less than or equal to 21.

To play the game, each player (human and computer) are given a set of 5 tiles. 
Each tile has an value and an associated score. 
For playing a tile, the player gets the associated score for that tile provided the total is less than 21.
